AWS Thought is a refactoring of my Deep-Thought project so it could be deployed to Amazon Web Services(AWS). AWS Thought allows users to share their thoughts and a corresponding image. The website uses React for the front end and Express-JS for the server. The website is deployed on an Ubuntu AMI using Amazon's EC2 service. The database uses Amazon's DynamoDB to store information such as the username, thought and image location. Images are stored using Amazon's S3 cloud storage system
